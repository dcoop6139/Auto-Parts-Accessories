      Resist the urge to recruit staff that we can afford before promises are
      converted into profit.

      We should never borrow money that is not neccessary.It always better to
      lighten the burden of finance by paying a little or zero percenmt
      interest.

      paying interest not only raises the financial risks it also decreases the
      overall retrun of investment.
