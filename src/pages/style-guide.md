The significant risks in this business are collecting information about different spare parts and their work function. We must be aware of their common problems and understand them in depth to address them in the future.
## Financial

      As we have mentioned earlier, there are not many barriers to starting an auto-spare parts business. Still, in financial terms, there is a risk in investment for the company to get started. We have planned to start the industry with various names, such as implementing a studio where the services can be done and providing a diverse collection of products and accessories from A-Z. Where the funding becomes crucial to commence the process that has been outlined, approaching stakeholders and making them understand the overall process of business and its percentage of profits would help overcome the financial risk to start the business.  

## Safety Measures

     Risk comes in several ways where employees can get hurt while loading the stuff from the inventory to the storefront for the customer's view since some parts are heavy. It has to be handled with safety measures to mitigate the risk safety measures like a rolling vehicle can be used to move the products from one place to another where the lifting can be avoided. Emergency First-Aid kits should be placed in case of unwelcomed scenarios.
